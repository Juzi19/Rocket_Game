## Features
The web app offers a simple and fun rocket game. The rocket tries to collect coins and avoids getting hit by obstacles. 
The game ends with crossing the game's borders or gets hit by an obstacle. The score can be saved by providing a username. Additionally you will also find a simple introduction to the game in German on the webpage.

## Example
The rocket can be maneuvered using the 'wasd' key and the 'space' key to trigger the rocket's boost function, resulting in a 3x speed. Boost power can be produced by flying on normal power. You can always control your rocket's boost level on the boost progress bar ontop. Nearby you'll also notice the level you're playing in and the amount of collected coins throughout all the levels you've passed. After providing a username, you can save your score to the leaderboard and compare yourself with the top players. You'll get redirected to the leaderboard after providing a username and permission. Alternatively, access the leaderboard by clicking on the 'Leaderboard' button.
There's also a help webpage explaining the game's core function in German.
